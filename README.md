<h1>Password Manager</h1>
<h2>This project proved to be an engaging exploration of regex usage for pattern validation, particularly in the context of email and password verification.
  Leveraging the regex module, I learned how to check and ensure the validity of these critical pieces of information. 
  Additionally, the project incorporated a Ceasar cipher encryption method to secure the password before storing it in a file, emphasizing the importance of data security.
  As a continued education in GUI development, it also introduced me to a couple of new modules, namely JSON for data storage and Pyperclip for efficient clipboard functionality.
  These valuable additions expanded my toolkit, enhancing my skills in GUI design and application development while reinforcing the significance of data integrity and user security.</h2>
